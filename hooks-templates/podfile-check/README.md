# Podfile Validation

## Why Use This Template

This hook validates your Podfile before commits to ensure it's correctly formatted and all dependencies can be resolved:

- **Dependency Validation**: Ensures all pods can be resolved
- **Format Checking**: Verifies Podfile syntax is correct
- **Early Warning**: Catches CocoaPods issues before they affect the team

## Benefits

- **Prevents Broken Builds**: Ensures the Podfile will work for all team members
- **Faster CI Pipelines**: Catches pod issues before they reach CI
- **Reduced Downtime**: Prevents situations where dependencies can't be installed
- **Better Dependency Hygiene**: Encourages maintaining clean and valid dependencies

## Requirements

Requires CocoaPods to be installed on the development machine.

## Recommended For

- iOS projects using CocoaPods for dependency management
- Teams where multiple developers modify dependencies
- Projects with complex dependency structures
- Legacy projects with potentially fragile dependency trees

This hook is particularly valuable when working with external dependencies that might change or become unavailable.
