# SwiftLint

## Why Use This Template

SwiftLint is a tool to enforce Swift style and conventions. It helps maintain code quality and consistency throughout your iOS project:

- Automatically fixes certain violations before they're committed
- Ensures consistent coding style across the team
- Identifies potential bugs and anti-patterns
- Encourages Swift best practices

## Benefits

- **Code Consistency**: Enforces a uniform coding style across the entire project
- **Code Quality**: Catches common Swift programming errors and anti-patterns
- **Efficient Reviews**: Reduces nitpicking in code reviews about style issues
- **Best Practices**: Helps team members learn and adopt Swift best practices

## Configuration

This hook uses a `.swiftlint.yml` file in your project root to customize rules. Make sure this file exists and is configured for your team's preferences.

## Recommended For

Any iOS project with Swift code, especially team projects where maintaining consistent style is important.
