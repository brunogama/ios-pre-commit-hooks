# Detect Secrets

## Why Use This Template

The detect-secrets hook prevents accidentally committing sensitive information like API keys, credentials, and tokens:

- **Security First**: Prevents credentials from being exposed in version control
- **Compliance**: Helps maintain security compliance requirements
- **Proactive Protection**: Catches secrets before they're committed

## Benefits

- **Prevent Data Breaches**: Stop sensitive information from being committed to the repository
- **Avoid Credential Rotation**: Eliminate the need to rotate credentials after accidental exposure
- **Maintain Security Posture**: Keep your application's security intact
- **Educate Developers**: Raises awareness about secure handling of credentials

## Configuration

Requires a `.secrets.baseline` file which you can generate with:

```bash
detect-secrets scan > .secrets.baseline
```

## Recommended For

- All projects that use API keys, tokens, or credentials
- Teams with varying levels of security awareness
- Projects with regulatory compliance requirements
- Open source projects that might accidentally expose contributor credentials

This hook is critical for any project where security is a concern (which should be all of them!).
