# pre-commit-configs

pre-commit-connfigs for ios development

## Installation

To install the pre-commit hooks using this configuration, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME/main/install | bash
```

**Note:** Ensure you have `curl`, `tar`, and `bash` installed on your system. You might need to update the URL in the command if your repository details or default branch (`main`) are different.

This command will download the necessary files and execute the `install-hooks` script to set up the pre-commit environment.
